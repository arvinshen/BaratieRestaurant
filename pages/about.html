            <h1>About Baratie</h1>
            <p>
                Baratie was founded on June 8, 1998 by head chef Zeff and his sous chef Sanji. 
                At the ages of 55 and 9 respectively, both Zeff and Sanji experienced an incident out on the seas. 
                They were left stranded on a big rock in the middle of the ocean with a huge sack of gold, but relatively no food.
                They were stranded for weeks and with all that gold with them, they couldn't even use it to buy food and nearly starved to death.
                Since this incident, Zeff and Sanji's goal has been to make sure no one goes hungry when they're out sailing the vast seas. 
                Located in the vast ocean of East Blue near the Grand Line, it is a one-of-a-kind ship that is the only floating restaurant in all the oceans.

                <p>
                    Chef Zeff was named "Best Chef: All Blue" by the James Beard Foundation in 1998. 
                    Baratie has been awarded three Michelin stars every year since it's opening.
                    Chef Zeff has also opened two additional restaurants, "Nasugasira" and "Anko", both receiving critical acclaim and world-wide recognition.
                    Both Nasugasira and Anko have also been awarded three Michelin stars every year since opening.
